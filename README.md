Hello, and thanks for stopping by! This repository contains examples of SQL, machine learning using Python, and Tableau-based data visualization that I have done so far. Feel free to have a look and to comment/contact for discussions.


# [Project 1: Machine learning using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)](https://github.com/TRSomo/Thabang_Portfolio/blob/main/Prediction%20of%20diabetes%20using%20KNN.pdf)
- In this project, I have built a machine learning model to predict diabetis status of patients (source: Kaggle)
- The following tasks were performed: data profiling, data cleaning, data visualization, feature correlation and machine learning

# [Project 2: Machine learning using Linear regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/TRSomo/Thabang_Portfolio/blob/main/Gibbs%20free%20energy.pdf)
- Herein, I have developed 3 predictive models based on Linear regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest
- The models predict Gibbs free energy of hydride formation in low, medium and high entropy alloys
- The data was curated and collected from different publications found on Google Scholar

# [Project 3: Creating store databases with SQL](https://github.com/TRSomo/Thabang_Portfolio/blob/main/create_store_database.sql)
- The project includes creating a dummy dataset for a store using SQL
- Multiple tables, including 'Products', 'Customers', 'Shippers', 'Orders', and 'Order_items', were created.

# [Project 4: Data visualization with Excel](https://github.com/TRSomo/Thabang_Portfolio/blob/main/Superstore%20sales%20dashboard_.xlsm)
- I analysed and visualised the sales for the superstore shop using Pivot tables to create excel dashboard (source: Data.world).

# [Project 5: Data visualization with Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/thabang.somo/viz/SalesanalysisdescriptiveforSuperstore/Dashboard1)
- For this project, I visualised the sales for the superstore shop (source: Data.world).
- The visuals include 'Monthly sales', 'Sales per state', 'Profit - discount correlations', 'profit per region', and so forth.
